This project is an analysis of data collected in 2015 asking participants to answer specific questions about their previous work day. 
The data was colelcted in preperation for a bigger project examining age differences in work behaviour of employees, testing hypotheses derived from Socioemotional Selectivity Theory.
In this analysis, we are testing the primary hypothesis that age is associated with greater likelihood of employees' reporting that they helped someone at work. A secondary hypothesis is that age is associated with better emotional well-being at work (ratio of PA to NA) and that helping others can account, at least in part, for this association

Some of the data had been previously analysed in SPSS, where weak positive correlations were found between age and the number of times employees reported helping someone else (r=0.19) and age and the frequency and intensity of positive emotions (r=0.18 and r=0.22 respectively).
This analysis did not make use of the repeated measures nature of the dataset, and did not examine the relationship between age, helping someone and emotional well-being in one model.

Use of the data and code in this project is not allowed without explicit consent from the author, and/or Professor Laura Carstensen.
